{{defn|A software model developed for programming {{gli|intelligent agent|intelligent agents}}. Superficially characterized by the implementation of an agent's ''beliefs'', ''desires'' and ''intentions'', it actually uses these concepts to solve a particular problem in agent programming.

Consequently, BDI agents are able to balance the time spent on deliberating about plans (choosing what to do) and executing those plans (doing it). A third activity, creating the plans in the first place (planning), is not within the scope of the model, and is left to the system designer and programmer.}}

{{defn|A technique for reducing the size of the [[State transition system|state-space]] to be searched by a [[model checking]] or [[automated planning and scheduling]] [[algorithm]].

{{defn|A generalization of a [[Markov decision process]] (MDP). A POMDP models an agent decision process in which it is assumed that the system dynamics are determined by an MDP, but the agent cannot directly observe the underlying state.

{{term|[[particle swarm optimization]] (PSO)}}
{{defn|A computational method that [[Mathematical optimization|optimizes]] a problem by [[iterative method|iteratively]] trying to improve a [[candidate solution]] with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed [[Point particle|particle]]s, and moving these particles around in the [[Optimization (mathematics)#Concepts and notation|search-space]] according to simple [[formula|mathematical formulae]] over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.}}

{{defn|A statistical procedure that uses an [[orthogonal transformation]] to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of [[Correlation and dependence|linearly uncorrelated]] variables called principal components. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible [[variance]] (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component, in turn, has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is [[orthogonal]] to the preceding components.
